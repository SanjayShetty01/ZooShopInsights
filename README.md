## About the game:

Evolution is an animal farm simulator game for discord servers. 

The farm allows you to choose animal kind, the selection of animal kind is just cosmetic rather than being functional (i.e. the payout & the cost of the animal are the same irrespective of the type of animal you select). You can buy an animal from the stores and upgrade them to the next level to get more coins. 

The game has four important aspects, they are:

1.  Evo Shop.
    
2.  Daily Store.
    
3.  Backyard.
    
4.  Stash.
    
    1.  **Evo Shop:** The place where you would buy the animal and will charge you 300 extra coins for each incremental buy (i.e. if you buy a Level 5 animal for 900 coins, the cost to buy the next level 5 animal would be 1200 coins).
        
    2.  **Daily Store:** The shop where six random animals would be displayed everyday with a discount. 
        
    3.  **Backyard:** The place where your animal stays to make you rich. The animals in the backyard would be the ones paying you the specified amount. It has a limit on the number of animals that are allowed to be held per level. (Usually 6/level)
        
    4.  **Stash:** When you exceed the above-mentioned limit, the extra animal is sent to the stash. In addition to the extra animals above the limit, any transaction involving 3 levels above the highest level would also be sent to the stash. (eg. : if the highest level animal in your backyard is 10, then if you buy any animal above 7 would be sent to the stash.)
